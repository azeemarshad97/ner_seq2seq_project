# Sequence-to-sequence workflows: Named Entity Recognition Project

NER project for the NLP course MÃ©thode Empirique en Traitement de Langage at UNIGE

In this assignment we will put together various steps involved in sequence-to-sequence workflow, from accessing the data to evaluating the output of a system

- Establish the baseline performance with a pre-neural tool
- Establish the baseline performance with a neural tool
- Analyse system outputs
- Propose and evaluate improvements over both baselines

_*Data set*_ : CoNLL2003 

_Pre-neural tool_ : crfsuite.
